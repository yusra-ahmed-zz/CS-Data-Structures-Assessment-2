Recursion
1. Recursion is a programming technique that calls a function inside itself until it reaches the base case.
2. It's necessary to have a base case because that's how the recursive function knows to stop calling itself.

1. Graphs are a kind of data structure that have nodes that are connected by edges that represent the relationship between the nodes.
2. Trees are hierarchical whereas graphs are not. The nodes in trees are acyclic and directed, while the nodes in graphs can be cyclic or acyclic, directed or non-directed.
